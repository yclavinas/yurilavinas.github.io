We have seen in class the basics of HTML, so now let's put our hands to work!
Here, we will create a personal webpage where you summarise your own CV.


1. a) Create a simple HTML document with the following structure:


```{r,eval=FALSE}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
  # for your picture (or something that looks nice) and nav items
  <h3>My first webpage.</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
  # for the rest of your info/text etc
      <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

b) Change the text with your name and the name of your website.

c) Personalize it with a short information of who you are. 

  - Example:
    - A short biography using 
    - Import hard skills
    - Import soft skills
    - Work experiences
    - Certifications
      - Be creative!
  
<br>  

2. Add some format to your text:

  - Bold text using < b > < /b >or < strong > < / strong >.
  - Italicized text using < i > or < em >.
  - Underlined text using < u >< /u >.
  - Strikethrough text using < s >< /s >

<br>

3. Let's organize it a little. Change your soft and hard skills section using lists:

a)  Make a list of the two main categories: soft and hard skills.
  
b) For that we start with the < ul >< /ul > tag, to indicate an urdered list will be created here.
  
c) Then, for each item, use the tag < li >< /li > and write the skill category inside.
  
d) Under the tag of each of the skills, create a nested ordered list < li >< /li > with the name of the skill.
  
<br>

4. Add links, in your biography, to the university our university and others if you went to any;
  - Example: A link to Google: < a href="https://www.google.com" >Google< /a >

<br>   

5. a) Add a beautiful image (maybe of yourself?) to your webpage using the < img > tag on the header section.
  - Example: < img src="path-to-your-image.jpg" alt="A description of the image" >

b) Resize the image using the width and height attributes.     

<br>

6. Build a contact section with:
  - A form, tag < form >< /form > that includes
  - Example:      
```{r,eval=FALSE}
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text">
```

  - Add an email input, changing the type attribute. 
  - Add an text input, changing the type attribute.
  
```{r,eval=FALSE}
  <label for="text">Text:</label>
  <textarea></textarea>
```

<br>

7. a) Add a placeholder, a text to indicate some information.

b) Change the input tags to be required, so that a submission cannot be made without all fields filled.

<br>

8. Your social media links as clickable icons using the <nav></nav> tag on the header section.

<br>

9. Interactive Elements

 - Include a button or link that allows users to download your CV as a PDF.
 - Use a < details > element for an expandable "More About Me" section.
